Hey Caeser my boy! How are you doing this morning?
One of our chickens,Gregory, got out last night and is causin a ruckus all around the forest and city
Now I know you are scared of chickens. But don't you worry, your sister is already out there looking it
When you are done with that, if you could, please head into the village and speak with Dave. I'm expecting an order of chicken seed order soon.
Thanks Caeser! Be careful and be back before lunch okay?
